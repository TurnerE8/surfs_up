#Overview and Purpose 

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the ideal times of the year to open a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu, Hawaii. After analyzing the yearly weather data, we wanted to drill down further into the months of June and December. Specifically, we queried the temperature data for these two months. After analyzing these two months' temperature data, we may be able to come to a decision as to whether or not the shop could be opened year round. 

##June/December Temperature Analysis 

The temperature data in June revealed an average temperature of 75 degrees with a maximum temperature of 85 degrees. The upper quartile reveals a temperature of 77 degrees. 
The temperature data in December revealed an average temperature of 71 degrees with a maximum temperature of 83 degrees. The upper quartile reveals a temperature of 74 degrees. 
There appears not to be much of a difference between the two months, although June appears to be a more comfortable month to enjoy surfing and eating ice cream in Oahu. 

#Summary 

The difference between December and June temperature is not so vast as to suggest closing up the shop for a period of time throughout the year. In fact, looking only at the temperatures, both months seem to be fairly reasonable weather for surfing and eating ice cream. However, I would perform two additional queries before making a decision as to 1) opening the shop in the first place and 2) whether to keep it open throughout the year. 

I would do a query to find the amount and frequency of precipitation throughout each of these months. Secondly, unrelated to weather data, I would be interested in seeing what months have the most tourist foot traffic. Having a better picture of the weather and what months we could expect a larger amount of foot traffic would help in making the final decision.
